# OpenWeatherChallenge

This project is built on [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/current#example_JSON). To use this, you'll need to get an app key, which can be done for free [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in). Once you have an API key you will need to add it to the project schema with the environment key "API_Key" in order for the app to function correctly.
